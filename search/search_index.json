This paper presents a novel Business-to-Business collaboration platform from the agri-food sector perspective, which aims to facilitate the collaboration of numerous stakeholders belonging to associated business domains, in an effective and flexible manner. This dataset provides a huge amount of information on crop production in India ranging from several years. Based on the Information the ultimate goal would be to predict crop production and find important insights highlighting key indicators and metrics that influence the crop production. Make views and dashboards first. Make a story out of it.</p>"},{"location":"#tools-used","title":"Tools Used","text":"<ul> <li>Python</li> <li>Tableau</li> <li>mkdocs for documentation</li> <li>EDA</li> <li>Data Preprocessing</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#dataset-resource","title":"Dataset resource","text":"<p>Resource Dataset</p>"},{"location":"architecture/","title":"Architecture Design Document","text":""},{"location":"architecture/#contents","title":"Contents","text":"<ol> <li>Introduction 1.1 What is Architecture Design Document? 1.2 Scope Architecture 2.1 Tableau Architecture 2.2 Tableau Server Architecture 2.3 Gateway/Load Balancer 2.4 Application Server 2.5 VIZQL Server 2.6 Data Engine 2.7 Backgrounder 2.8 Data Server 2.9 Tableau Communication Flow Deployment 3.1 Deployment Options in Tableau 3.2 Single Node Architecture 3.3 Three Node Architecture 3.4 Five Node Architecture</li> </ol>"},{"location":"architecture/#1-introduction","title":"1. Introduction","text":"<p>Our Indian Crop Analysis Prediction project aims to revolutionize agriculture by leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. By analyzing extensive data sets related to crop yields, weather patterns, soil composition, and market trends, we seek to develop accurate predictions for crop productivity and identify potential risks and opportunities. This project will empower farmers and policymakers with actionable insights to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, mitigate crop failures, and maximize agricultural output. By harnessing the power of technology, we strive to enhance food security, improve livelihoods, and drive sustainable growth in India's agricultural sector.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/#2architecture","title":"2.Architecture","text":""},{"location":"architecture/#tableau-server-architecture","title":"Tableau Server Architecture","text":"<p>Tableau's n-tier, highly scalable client-server architecture supports desktop-installed software, web clients, and mobile clients.
